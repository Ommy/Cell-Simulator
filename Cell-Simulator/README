This was a program I worked on in highschool.

It is a basic cell simulator that shows the effect of viruses on the human body's blood cells.

It also shows the effects that white blood cells have on virues.

The application is designed to allow for the user to create the scenario, and see how it will play out.
It allows for the following user input:

  *Number of Blood Cells
  *Number of Viruses
  *Number of White Blood Cells
  *Regeneration Rate of Red Blood Cells

**NOTE: This application isn't completely medically accurate, but goes off the base idea of what each of the cells will
**do.
